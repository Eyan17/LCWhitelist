This is a whitelist mod for the game Lethal Company. It checks the config file when someone joins and checks if their username is inside and disconnects them otherwise.

To set the whitelist, see the config file. You can edit the config file at any time, and it will sync up with the game. For this, it is preferable to use LethalConfig.

This mod is server-side.
