This is a whitelist mod for the game Lethal Company. It works by checking if all connected players' names are included in the config file. If someone's is not, they will be kicked out.

To set the whitelist, see the config file. You can edit the config file at any time, and it will sync up with the game. For this, it is preferable to use LethalConfig.

The mod is server-side.
